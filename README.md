# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Welcome to my **Rock-Paper-Scissors** repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic game, where players can challenge the computer in a fun, interactive interface. It's an ideal project for practicing JavaScript logic and web development fundamentals.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a platform where I can:

- Build a fully functional **Rock-Paper-Scissors game**.
- Enhance understanding of **JavaScript** by implementing game logic and DOM manipulation.
- Practice **CSS styling** and **responsive design** for a visually appealing interface.
- Learn to use **event listeners** and update elements dynamically based on user input.
- Improve skills in **HTML structure** and **UI/UX design**.

## Technologies

This repository uses core web development technologies:

- **HTML5**: To set up a simple and accessible layout.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including animations and responsive design elements.
- **JavaScript**: To handle game logic, user interaction, and dynamic updates to the UI.

## Key Features

- **Player vs. Computer Gameplay**: Users choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer makes a random choice.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current score for both the player and the computer.
- **Round Results**: Shows the result of each round (win, lose, or draw) along with the choices made.
- **Game Reset**: Allows users to reset scores and rounds, starting a fresh game anytime.
